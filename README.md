**Measurement trust and trace-to-training backend for WasmAgent.**

> *evomerge-framework is the research backend that tells you whether your evaluation is trustworthy and whether your runtime traces are safe enough to become training data.*

This repository is the third layer of the [WasmAgent Trustworthy Agent Training Loop](docs/ecosystem-map.md):

```
wasmagent-js  →  bscode  →  evomerge-framework  →  better runtime
(runtime)        (workload)  (measurement + data)    (fed back)
```

It has two modules:

1. **`eval_trust`** — benchmark audit: paired statistics, contamination checks, T0v2 triage.
   Companion to *"Silent Contamination in LLM Merging Evaluation"* ([paper](papers/eval_trust/draft.pdf)).
2. **`evomerge`** — trace-to-training pipeline: `ComplianceEvalRecord` → SFT / DPO / router records.
```

## Why this exists

We spent **5 months** chasing a **+10 pp** GSM8K improvement on a Qwen2.5-1.5B
merge that survived three rounds of verification, paired McNemar
significance (p = 0.015), and multi-seed runs. Then we noticed
`max_new_tokens` was hardcoded to 300 in our generation runner.

Re-ran with `max_new_tokens=768`. The +10 pp **collapsed to −1.0 pp**
(p = 0.89). The "improvement" was the baseline being silently truncated
more often than the merge candidate.

This toolkit is the audit we wish we had run on day 1.

(30 pages, 3 figures, 23 references — tells the full story).

## 30-second demo: reproduce the case-study flip

```bash
git clone https://github.com/telleroutlook/evomerge-framework
cd evomerge-framework
pip install scipy
python - <<'PY'
import json
from scipy.stats import binomtest

# Real raw logs from the case study (n=199, both runs evaluated greedy on
# the same GSM8K dev items, only max_new_tokens differs):
with open("data/winner_max_new768.json") as f:
    winner = json.load(f)
with open("data/instruct_max_new768.json") as f:
    instruct = json.load(f)

wm = {r["id"]: r["correct"] for r in winner["results"] if "correct" in r}
im = {r["id"]: r["correct"] for r in instruct["results"] if "correct" in r}
common = sorted(set(wm) & set(im))
b = sum(1 for i in common if im[i] and not wm[i])  # Instruct-only correct
c = sum(1 for i in common if not im[i] and wm[i])  # winner-only correct
p = binomtest(min(b, c), b + c, p=0.5, alternative="two-sided").pvalue

print(f"AUDITED: n={len(common)}, b={b}, c={c}, p={p:.4f}")
# AUDITED: n=199, b=29, c=27, p=0.8939   ← the +10 pp wasn't real

# For comparison, here's the same paired test on the BROKEN protocol
# (max_new=300, the original Phase 13 numbers):
print("ORIGINAL: n=200, b=21, c=41, p=0.0151   ← was paired-significant")
PY
```

Output:

```
AUDITED:  n=199, b=29, c=27, p=0.8939   ← the +10 pp wasn't real
ORIGINAL: n=200, b=21, c=41, p=0.0151   ← was paired-significant
```

That's the entire case study, on real data, in one screenful.

## What's in the toolkit

📖 **[EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md)** — 16 copy-pasteable recipes (10 eval_trust + 6 evomerge pipeline).
🐍 **[`examples/`](examples/)** — same 16 as standalone runnable .py.
🛠️ **[`Makefile`](Makefile)** — dev shortcuts (`make help`).
🧪 **[`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/)** — synthetic ground-truth self-test.
📄 **[`papers/eval_trust/`](papers/eval_trust/)** — paper PDF + LaTeX + figures + scripts.
📄 **[`papers/compliance_model/`](papers/compliance_model/)** — compliance training report + schema novelty analysis.

```
eval_trust/   paired_stats / conformal_ci / lm_eval_bridge / t0v2/
evomerge/     schemas / pipeline / eval / router / synthesize / export
data/         case-study logs + synthetic + quantization summary
tests/        288 tests (53 eval_trust + 235 evomerge pipeline)
```

**eval_trust**: Pure Python + NumPy + (optional) SciPy. No GPU. No model inference.
**evomerge**: Pydantic v2 + scikit-learn (optional). Converts compliance traces to training data.

## Three reasons to use it

**1. Cheap.** Audit cost ~milliseconds on 200 items. A `pytest` run
takes 0.04 s. The case study took 4 hours of laptop time end-to-end.

**2. Falsifiable.** Every channel is a deterministic predicate on
`(question, expected, gen_text)`. No probabilistic classifier, no
LLM-as-judge, no opaque model — you can replicate every label by hand.

**3. Embarrassing if you don't.** A small-delta merging claim on a
standard benchmark, without a paired McNemar `(b, c)` count and a
SC-5 lottery rate report, is consistent with a real improvement, with
a primitive contamination, and with several mechanisms in between. The
audit costs you nothing and removes the ambiguity. Reviewers will
increasingly expect it.

## Tests

```bash
pip install scipy pytest
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/ -q
```

Or via the project Makefile (`make help` shows all 14 targets):

```bash
make install    # pip install -e ".[dev]"
make pytest     # 226 unit + integration tests
make ci         # everything CI runs (test + lint + reproducer + self-test + examples)
make paper      # rebuild draft.pdf + arxiv_upload.tar.gz (needs pandoc + tectonic)
```

## WasmAgent trace-to-training pipeline (`evomerge` package)

This repository also contains a second package — `evomerge` — that converts
WasmAgent runtime traces into training data for compliance-conditioned small
model post-training.

### Install

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 30-second demo: fixture → SFT + DPO

```bash
python -m evomerge export \
  --rollout fixtures/data-loop/rollout-branches.v1.jsonl \
  --out-dir /tmp/demo
cat /tmp/demo/manifest.json
# {"n_sft": 1, "n_dpo": 1, "n_ppo": 2, ...}
```

### Package layout

```
evomerge/
├── schemas/        Pydantic models (RolloutBranchRecord, ComplianceEvalRecord,
│                   SftTrainingRecord, DpoTrainingRecord, PpoTrainingRecord …)
├── pipeline/       trace → SFT / DPO / PPO / compliance-SFT converters
├── io.py           load_jsonl / write_jsonl / load_rollouts / load_router_records
├── export.py       run_export() — full pipeline in one call
├── validate/       contamination (8-gram Jaccard) + schema structural checks
├── synthesize/     TaskSpec templates + SyntheticGenerator (teacher model)
├── eval/           EvalHarness (A/B/C/D/E groups), EvalMetrics, stat_bridge
├── router/         RouterFeatures, RouterLabel, RouterRuleClassifier
└── __main__.py     CLI: export / router / validate / synthesize
```

### CLI

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `python -m evomerge export` | rollout + compliance JSONL → sft/dpo/ppo/router.jsonl |
| `python -m evomerge validate` | schema + contamination check on any training JSONL |
| `python -m evomerge router` | batch routing predictions with rule classifier |
| `python -m evomerge synthesize` | generate synthetic samples via teacher model |

### Schema contract

Schemas mirror wasmagent-js TypeScript interfaces and are validated by CI:

```bash
python scripts/check-schema-fields.py
# [OK] rollout-wire (contract)
# [OK] training-record/dpo (contract)
# ✓ no schema drift detected
```

Pass `--wasmagent-js /path/to/repo` to check against the canonical JSON Schema files.

### Shared fixture

`fixtures/data-loop/rollout-branches.v1.jsonl` — 2-branch rollout fixture
(1 pass / 1 fail). Must be byte-identical across evomerge-framework, wasmagent-js,
and bscode. Sync all three repos in the same PR when changing.

### Recipes

| File | Topic |
|---|---|
| `examples/recipe11_rollout_to_sft.py` | rollout JSONL → SFT records |
| `examples/recipe12_rollout_to_dpo.py` | rollout JSONL → DPO preference pairs |
| `examples/recipe13_compliance_sft.py` | ComplianceEvalRecord → answerer + repairer |
| `examples/recipe14_eval_harness.py` | A/B/C/D/E comparison harness |
| `examples/recipe15_significance.py` | McNemar + bootstrap: C > A at p < 0.05 |
