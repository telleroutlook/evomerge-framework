"""Convert ComplianceEvalRecord list → DPO preference pairs.

Implements plan Section 6 Phase 2: "用 deterministic verifier + teacher model
+ human review 共同构造偏好数据".

Pairing strategy:
  chosen  — the artifact that passed all constraints (final_pass=True, fewest
             repair rounds or zero violations)
  rejected — either:
    (a) an earlier draft that violated constraints (artifact before repair), or
    (b) a synthetic bad output injected by the caller via `bad_outputs`

When a ComplianceEvalRecord has repair_trace entries, each round that
transitioned from failing to passing can produce one chosen/rejected pair:
  chosen   = final compliant artifact
  rejected = what the model produced before the repair that resolved violations

If no repair trace is available (record passed on first attempt) and no
bad_outputs are provided, the record is skipped — a passing-only record
yields no preference signal.
