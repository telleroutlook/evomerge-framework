"""MCP security evaluation record — schema for logging firewall decisions.

Records one security evaluation event per tool call attempt.
Consumed by evomerge pipeline to build MCP security training datasets
and benchmark against MCPTox/AgentDojo/MCP-SafetyBench style tasks.

Mirrors the TypeScript types in @wasmagent/mcp-firewall but uses
Pydantic for Python-side validation.
