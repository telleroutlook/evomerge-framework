## Executive Summary

**The WasmAgent compliance schema is genuinely novel.** Adversarial verification
against 6 primary sources (AutoGen, IFEval, FollowBench, MINT, ETO,
arXiv:2509.18847) confirms that no existing framework provides a unified,
versioned, typed JSON Schema that jointly encodes:

1. Formal task constraints as a structured IR (`TaskSpec` + `ConstraintIR`)
2. Structured violation evidence with typed categories and location pointers (`ConstraintViolation` + `EvidenceSpan`)
3. Multi-step repair history as discrete typed entries (`RepairTraceEntry`)

in a single machine-readable record suitable for both RLAIF preference
construction and compliance auditing (`ComplianceEvalRecord`).

**Confidence: HIGH** — derived from 15 confirmed claims, 10 killed claims,
and adversarial 3-vote verification per claim.

## Gap Analysis by Schema Component

### 1. `TaskSpec` / `ConstraintIR` — Task specification as structured IR

**What exists:**

| Framework | Task specification | Gap vs WasmAgent |
|---|---|---|
| AutoGen (arXiv:2308.08155) | Natural-language string + Python config params | No typed constraint IR, no priority hierarchy, no repair policy |
| IFEval (arXiv:2311.07911) | Flat JSONL: `{key, instruction_id_list, prompt, kwargs}` | Opaque string IDs (e.g. `punctuation:no_comma`), untyped kwargs, no repair |
| FollowBench (arXiv:2310.20410) | 5-category taxonomy (Content/Situation/Format/Example/Mixed) stacked at 5 levels | Produces only CSV booleans, no machine-readable ConstraintIR, no repair policy |
| LangGraph | Python type annotations on StateGraph dicts | Not a JSON Schema, no constraint level/category/repair metadata |
| OpenAI function calling | Typed tool schema (JSON Schema for args) | Only tool-call validity, not task-level constraint compliance |

**WasmAgent's contribution:**
`ConstraintIR` extends `Criterion` with `level` (hard/soft), `priority`,
`category` (format/content/style/tool/state/security/semantic), and `repair`
(strategy + target_region). This is the first typed constraint IR that:
- Distinguishes hard vs soft constraints
- Carries a per-constraint repair policy
- Is machine-readable JSON Schema (not Python type annotations)

**Verified claim (3-0):** *"AutoGen specifies agent tasks through natural-language prompts and Python configuration parameters, not a typed schema with formal constraints."*

### 2. `ConstraintViolation` + `EvidenceSpan` — Structured violation with location

**What exists:**

| Framework | Verification output | Gap vs WasmAgent |
|---|---|---|
| IFEval | `follow_all_instructions: bool`, `follow_instruction_list: list[bool]` | No violation type, no location pointer, no evidence span |
| FollowBench | Per-constraint bool (HSR/SSR), aggregated as CSV | No typed violation record, no evidence span, no location pointer |
| MINT (arXiv:2309.10691) | `success: bool`, `feedback: str` (GPT-4 natural language) | Free-text feedback, no typed error structure, no location |
| ETO (arXiv:2403.02502) | Final scalar reward only | No violation record at all |
| arXiv:2509.18847 | Tool-Reflection-Bench: 4 programmatic dimensions | Still no typed JSON Schema for violation records |

**WasmAgent's contribution:**
`ConstraintViolation` carries `constraint_id`, `level`, `category`, `hint`,
`detected_at` (stage), and `evidence_span`. The `EvidenceSpan` sub-schema
provides four location pointers:
- `region_id` — semantic region label (e.g. `section:Conclusion`)
- `json_pointer` — RFC 6901 pointer for JSON outputs
- `char_range` — half-open character range `[start, end)`
- `line_range` — inclusive line range `[start, end]`

**This is the only violation schema with spatial localization into LLM output.**
All other frameworks produce binary pass/fail or natural-language strings.

**Verified claim (3-0):** *"IFEval's input schema is a flat JSONL with four fields... there is no structured violation type, no evidence span, no location pointer into LLM output."*

**Verified claim (3-0):** *"MINT's evaluation framework stores agent state as a flat list of conversation turns... it does not define structured violation records."*

---

### 3. `RepairTraceEntry` — Structured repair history

**What exists:**

| Framework | Repair record | Gap vs WasmAgent |
|---|---|---|
| AutoGen (v0.2) | Error passed back as conversation message (free text) | No typed repair trace |
| AutoGen (v0.4+) | `CodeExecutionResult` + structured retry loop | Per-execution result only, not multi-round compliance repair with rollback |
| Self-Refine (2023) | Natural-language feedback → revised output | No typed trace, no violation reference, no strategy field |
| Reflexion (NeurIPS 2023) | Verbal reflection in episodic memory | Unstructured natural language, no machine-readable schema |
| arXiv:2509.18847 | Reflect-Call-Final stepwise trajectory | **Closest analogue** — but still lacks typed JSON Schema for violation records or constraint IR |

**WasmAgent's contribution:**
`RepairTraceEntry` records per round: `violation_ids` (which constraints were
targeted), `strategy` (patch/insert_section/regenerate_region/full), `ok`
(did it succeed), `rolled_back` (regression detected), `remaining_violation_ids`,
`token_cost`, and `latency_ms`.

The key difference from arXiv:2509.18847 ("Failure Makes the Agent Stronger"):
that work's Reflect-Call-Final format is a trajectory format for RL training
(implicit, model-generated), not a typed schema for compliance auditing.
WasmAgent's `RepairTraceEntry` is both: it drives the repair loop AND serves
as a structured training record.

**Verified claim (3-0, medium confidence):** *"arXiv:2509.18847 proposes 'structured reflection' as a Reflect-Call-Final trajectory format... yet it still lacks a typed JSON Schema for violation records, constraint IR, or a unified compliance eval record."*

### 4. `ComplianceEvalRecord` — Unified audit + training record

**What exists:** Nothing equivalent found in any verified source.

ETO's preference data is `D_p = {(u, e_w, e_l)}` — a 3-tuple with no
additional fields. IFEval's `OutputExample` has 5 fields. MINT's `State`
has `history + success + token_counts`.

WasmAgent's `ComplianceEvalRecord` is the first unified record that:
- Links to `task_spec_hash` (immutable constraint set)
- Records `mode` (direct/prompt_retry/full_pcl)
- Embeds full `violations[]` and `repair_trace[]`
- Tracks `repair_rounds`, `final_pass`, `token_cost`, `latency_ms`
- Can be used as **both** a compliance audit record **and** an RLAIF training record

## The Three-Property Sufficiency Argument

The WasmAgent schema satisfies three properties that existing work lacks in
combination:

**Property 1: Verifiability** — *TaskSpec + ConstraintIR*
Task constraints must be formally specifiable and deterministically checkable.
IFEval gets close (typed instruction IDs) but produces no downstream IR for
repair. ConstraintIR adds `level`, `category`, `repair` to close the gap.

**Property 2: Locatability** — *ConstraintViolation + EvidenceSpan*
Verification output must identify *where* in the output the violation occurs,
not just *whether* it occurs. To our knowledge, this property is absent in all
verified sources. Without it, repair can only be global (full rewrite); with
it, repair can be local (patch/insert_section targeting `char_range` or
`json_pointer`).

**Property 3: Trainability** — *RepairTraceEntry*
The path from error to repair must be recorded in a machine-readable form
suitable for preference data construction. ETO provides trajectory pairs but
no violation rationale. arXiv:2509.18847 provides a trajectory format but
not a JSON Schema.

To our knowledge, no prior agent-training framework exposes all three
properties — verifiability, locatability, and trainability — in a single
open JSON Schema suitable for both audit and preference construction.

### Closest Systems Comparison

| System | Typed task constraints | Localized violation evidence | Typed repair trace | Training pair construction | Runtime audit record |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| IFEval | Partial | No | No | No | Partial |
| FollowBench | Taxonomy only | No | No | No | Partial |
| Guardrails / Instructor | Output schema | Partial | No | No | Partial |
| AutoGen | No | No | Free-text/log | No | Partial |
| ETO | No | No | Trajectory only | Yes | No |
| Failure Makes the Agent Stronger (arXiv:2509.18847) | No | No | Trajectory format | Yes | Partial |
| **WasmAgent Compliance** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |

```
ComplianceEvalRecord (verifiable + locatable + trainable)
    → compliance_to_sft_records()    (answerer + repairer training)
    → compliance_to_dpo_records()    (repair-trace preference pairs)
    → cross_mode_dpo_records()       (mode-comparison preference pairs)
    → RouterRecord                   (escalation classifier training)
```

## Closest Prior Art and How to Differentiate

**arXiv:2509.18847** ("Failure Makes the Agent Stronger", Su et al., 2025–2026)
is the closest existing work. Key differences:

| Dimension | arXiv:2509.18847 | WasmAgent |
|---|---|---|
| Repair representation | Implicit trajectory (model-generated reflection) | Typed JSON Schema (`RepairTraceEntry`) |
| Constraint specification | None (task is a natural-language string) | `TaskSpec` + `ConstraintIR` with priority/category/repair policy |
| Violation record | None (failure is implicit in reward) | `ConstraintViolation` with `EvidenceSpan` location pointers |
| Training objective | RL (DAPO+GSPO) | SFT + DPO from structured records |
| Interoperability | Self-contained benchmark | JSON Schema → any downstream trainer |

This comparison should appear in the Related Work section of any paper using
WasmAgent's schema.

## Open Questions Identified by Research

1. Does LangGraph's StateGraph define a typed JSON Schema for task constraints
   (as opposed to Python type annotations) that could constitute prior art for
   `ConstraintIR`?

2. Does the OpenAI Assistants API or Anthropic tool use include typed
   violation/repair records, or are these also flat string outputs?

3. Has any subsequent work (2026) formalized arXiv:2509.18847's Tool-Reflection-Bench
   dimensions into a published JSON Schema standard?
