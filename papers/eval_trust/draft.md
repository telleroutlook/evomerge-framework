# Abstract

We spent five months convinced we had merged a Qwen2.5-1.5B variant that beat
the Instruct baseline on GSM8K by **+10pp** ($\Delta$=10.0pp, McNemar exact p=0.015).
The headline survived re-runs, hyperparameter sweeps, and two independent rounds
of "verification". Then a single configuration audit — `max_new_tokens` had been
hardcoded to 300 in our generation runner — flipped the result. Under the
corrected protocol (`max_new_tokens=768`), the merged model's improvement over
Instruct collapsed to **-1.0pp** (paired McNemar two-sided p=0.89). The +10pp
was not merging; it was the baseline being silently truncated more often than
the merge candidate, in a way that the metric had been silently rewarding.

We use this autopsy as evidence that *measurement primitives* — the concrete
generation, parsing, and aggregation choices that sit beneath any benchmark
number — are a systematic and silent source of false positives in model merging
research. We catalog three such primitives that materially affected our project
(generation truncation, single-greedy lottery, per-tensor quantization
granularity), provide a multi-channel triage protocol that exposes them
automatically from existing logs, and release `eval_trust`, an Apache-2.0
toolkit bundling paired statistics, conformal CI, and the audit heuristics we
wish we had used at the start. The toolkit is offered not as a theoretical
contribution but as the cheapest known patch for a recurrent failure mode in
small-delta merging claims.

# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Why measurement, not algorithms, is the bottleneck

Model merging research moves quickly. Within roughly two years, the field has
produced a sequence of widely cited algorithms — TIES [@ties2024],
DARE [@dare2024], DELLA [@della2024], Breadcrumbs [@breadcrumbs2024],
SCE [@sce_mergekit], plus dozens of variants — each demonstrating gains of a few
percentage points on standard benchmarks (GSM8K, MMLU, IFEval, HumanEval).
Several of those gains are on the order of the *paired* standard error of the
benchmark itself.

When the algorithmic deltas under study are 1–5 pp, the *protocols* generating
those numbers become first-order:

- the maximum number of generated tokens (`max_new_tokens`),
- the sampling regime (greedy, temperature, top-p, self-consistency $k$),
- the prompt and chat templates,
- the answer extractor (regex, LaTeX-aware, comma normalisation),
- quantization granularity if any of the candidates are quantized,
- the random seeds and how many.

We argue these *measurement primitives* are not bookkeeping. They are part of
the metric, and a hardcoded default in any of them is a hidden *protocol*, not
a neutral default. Worse, they fail silently: a wrong primitive doesn't crash
the evaluation, it just biases the resulting number, often asymmetrically across
candidates that happen to differ in chain length, output style, or quantization
sensitivity.

This paper provides three pieces of evidence and one toolkit:

1. **A documented case study** in which a +10 pp merging claim survived five
   months and three rounds of verification before a measurement-primitive audit
   flipped its sign. The case is from our own project; the artefact is publicly
   archived and reproducible (Appendix B).
2. **Two further primitives** — single-greedy lottery and per-tensor int4
   quantization — that produced changes of 12.5 pp and up to 63 pp respectively
   in our setup, none of which is detectable by the headline metric alone.
3. **A multi-channel triage protocol** (T0v2) that classifies wrong answers in
   six diagnostic buckets, runs on existing log files (no re-evaluation), and
   tells the practitioner whether the next step is *fix the measurement*, *do
   surgical repair*, or *accept the reasoning bottleneck*.
4. **`eval_trust`**, an Apache-2.0 Python toolkit packaging the audit
   heuristics, paired statistics (McNemar exact, Wilson CI, paired bootstrap),
   conformal CI, and a checkpoint/resume experiment runner. Roughly 1200 lines
   of code with 53 unit tests covering the toolkit's modules. Designed to sit
   *next to* lm-eval-harness [@lmeval2023], not replace it.

## 1.2 Concrete propositions

The case study supports three concrete and falsifiable propositions:

**P1 (Truncation asymmetry).** A `max_new_tokens` cap shorter than the 95th
percentile of the benchmark's chain-of-thought length distribution
asymmetrically penalises candidates whose chain length distributions differ
from the baseline. In our case study, `max_new_tokens=300` produced an apparent
+10 pp gap that became -1.0 pp under `max_new_tokens=768`, with paired McNemar
flipping from $p=0.015$ to $p=0.89$.

**P2 (Greedy lottery floor).** Single-greedy decoding inflates apparent
differences by treating an unstable subset of "wrong" answers as definitively
wrong. On the case-study model, self-consistency with $k=5$ samples
(temperature 0.5, top-p 0.95) recovers $25/65 = 38.5\%$ of greedy-wrong
answers. The single-model implication: a single greedy decode misses ~12.5 pp
of items that are recoverable under SC-5 majority. The two-model implication
(\S5.1.3) is weaker but practically useful: any single-greedy delta below
this per-model lottery rate should be cross-checked under SC before being
claimed.

**P3 (Quantization granularity).** "int4 quant" without granularity is a
meaningless specification. Per-tensor int4 quantization of our 1.5 B candidate
collapsed GSM8K accuracy to $0\%$. The same model under group-32 int4
quantization (group_size $= 32$, akin to GGUF Q4_K_M block size) achieved
$63\%$ — a 63-pp swing attributable purely to the granularity choice
(winner-int4 row of \S5.2.2).

## 1.3 Contributions

- **C1 (case study, \S3).** A reproducible autopsy of a merging claim that
  inverted under measurement audit.
- **C2 (T0v2 triage, \S4).** A multi-channel error-classification protocol
  designed to expose measurement-primitive contamination from log files alone.
  Six predicate-based channels classify a wrong answer as truncation,
  extractor failure, single-step arithmetic error, self-correction
  regression, token-mismatch, or reasoning-bottleneck residue.
- **C3 (`eval_trust` toolkit, \S6).** Apache-2.0 Python package implementing
  the T0v2 protocol of C2 alongside paired statistics (McNemar exact, Wilson
  CI, paired bootstrap), conformal CI, and a checkpoint/resume experiment
  runner. The toolkit ships with 53 unit tests covering its own modules; the
  remainder of our project's 288-test suite covers the evomerge data-pipeline
  and compliance training infrastructure and is not part of the toolkit.
- **C4 (audit checklist, Appendix A).** A 10-item yes/no checklist any merging
  paper draft should pass before claiming a delta below 10 pp.

## 1.4 What this paper is *not*

It is not a new merging algorithm; we use linear and chat-vector merges
[@ortiz2024chatvector], both standard. It is not a benchmark; we use GSM8K
[@cobbe2021gsm8k], HumanEval [@chen2021codex], IFEval [@zhou2023ifeval], and
MMLU [@hendrycks2020mmlu]. It is not a critique of any specific paper; the
case study is on our own work. We do not have a paired *false negative* — a
real improvement that was missed because of the same primitive failures —
although the symmetry of the underlying mechanism strongly suggests such
cases exist in the literature (\S8).

# 2 Background

## 2.1 Model merging in two paragraphs

Model merging combines specialised fine-tunes of a shared base into a single
weight set via parameter arithmetic, without any training step. The simplest
form is a weighted linear combination; richer recipes (TIES [@ties2024],
DARE [@dare2024], DELLA [@della2024], Breadcrumbs [@breadcrumbs2024]) prune,
sign-align, or otherwise reshape the difference vectors before combination.
Chat-vector merges [@ortiz2024chatvector] add a difference vector derived
from `(Instruct - Base)` at a tunable coefficient, which is the recipe
underlying our case study.

The community has consolidated around two evaluation regimes: (a) curated
multi-domain benchmarks like MergeBench [@mergebench2025], which evaluate a
merged model's multi-task aggregate; and (b) targeted benchmarks like GSM8K,
HumanEval, IFEval, MMLU, used to pinpoint whether a merge improved one
specific capability. Our case study is in regime (b), where the deltas under
study are typically 1–10 pp.

## 2.2 The measurement-primitive concept

We borrow *primitive* from systems and software engineering: a concrete
implementation choice upstream of every metric. Examples in LLM evaluation:

| Primitive | Typical default | Possible silent biases |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| `max_new_tokens` | 256, 300, 512 (varies) | Asymmetric truncation by chain length |
| Sampling | greedy (`do_sample=False`) | Lottery; one model's noise floor differs from another's |
| Prompt template | "system + user" | Template mismatch with fine-tune's training distribution |
| Answer extractor | `\b\d+\b`, `#### N`, LaTeX `\boxed{}` | Misses correct answers in non-standard formats |
| Quantization | "int4", "int8" | Granularity, group size, calibration set silently determine accuracy |
| Random seed | 0 or unfixed | One seed can hide multi-pp variance |

Primitives share three properties:

- **Silent.** A wrong primitive does not raise an error. It returns a number,
  which is then aggregated and compared.
- **Drifting.** A runner copied from one project to another inherits stale
  defaults. The new project's distribution may not match the runner's
  assumptions.
- **Asymmetric.** A primitive's bias may differ across compared candidates.
  Truncation hits longer chains harder; per-tensor int4 hits matrices with
  skewed singular values harder; greedy lottery hits a model whose top-1 is
  near a tie with top-2 harder.

Asymmetry is the dangerous property. A symmetric bias subtracts out under
paired statistics; an asymmetric bias becomes the signal.

## 2.3 Existing eval-trust tooling and its gaps

The community has reasonably good infrastructure for the *standard* protocol
problem: lm-eval-harness [@lmeval2023] standardises generation, extraction, and
scoring across hundreds of benchmarks; HELM [@helm2022] layers normalisation; and
official task implementations exist for most popular benchmarks.

The gap is *audit*: tooling that takes a run that already happened — possibly
under a non-standard runner — and answers the question "is this result
contaminated by a measurement primitive?". Most projects roll their own
runner, often forking an early reference, and accumulate divergent defaults.
Our project is one such case: our `gsm8k_runner.py` defaulted to
`max_new_tokens=300`, an inheritance from an early prototype that nobody had
audited in five months of use.

Paired statistics (McNemar, Wilson CI, paired bootstrap) are folklore in the
merging community but rarely reported beyond a single $p$-value. Conformal
calibration, useful when batch sizes are small, is nearly absent. Multi-seed
runs are common but often pooled rather than analysed for between-seed
variance. We packaged these in `eval_trust` (\S6).

## 2.4 Scope of the present work

Three primitives, one base-model family (Qwen2.5-1.5B), one benchmark family
(GSM8K + locality on HumanEval/IFEval/MMLU). The *concept* of measurement-
primitive contamination is broader; the specific magnitudes we report are
specific to this setup. Section 8 discusses what generalises and what does not.

# 3 Case study: a 5-month +10pp that wasn't there

This section is a chronological autopsy. It is intentionally specific: the
artefact, the verification rounds that failed to catch it, and the audit
that finally did.

## 3.1 The setup

Our project ("evomerge") aims to deliver Pareto-optimal compressed models
under customer-specified constraints (size, accuracy, latency). Phase 13
(2026-04 to 2026-05) was a search for the best 1.5 B GSM8K-capable merge over
the Qwen2.5 family. The base model was `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`. Candidate
parents included `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B`, `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct`,
and chat-vector difference vectors derived from `(Instruct - Base)` and from
the Math/Coder analogs.

The search explored linear, TIES, ortho-merge, and chat-vector recipes. The
best candidate found, hereafter the **winner**, was

  $$\theta_{winner} = \theta_{Coder} + 0.7 \cdot (\theta_{Instruct} - \theta_{Base})$$

a chat-vector add at coefficient $\lambda = 0.7$ on top of the Coder base.
The $\lambda$ sweep is documented in `phase13_3_coder_chat/summary.md`.

Evaluation was on a fixed 200-question subset of GSM8K test, using our internal
`gsm8k_runner.py` with greedy decoding. Paired statistics (McNemar exact,
Wilson 95% CI on the difference, paired bootstrap) were computed against the
Instruct baseline on the same item set.

## 3.2 The reported claim

| Configuration | Correct / 200 | Accuracy | $\Delta$ vs Instruct | McNemar p | Wilson 95% CI |
|---------------|--------------:|---------:|--------------:|----------:|---------------|
| Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct (baseline) | 99 / 200 | 49.5% | — | — | — |
| Coder + 1.0·chat_vec (Phase 11.3) | 111 / 200 | 55.5% | +6.0 pp | 0.162 | [-2, +14] |
| Coder + 0.7·chat_vec (winner) | 119 / 200 | 59.5% | +10.0 pp | 0.015 | [+3, +18] |
| Coder + 1.2·chat_vec | 118 / 200 | 59.0% | +9.5 pp | 0.016 | [+2, +17] |
| Coder + 1.5·chat_vec | 113 / 200 | 56.5% | +7.0 pp | 0.087 | [-1, +14] |

The "winner" row — Coder + 0.7·chat_vec — is the candidate that drove the
+10 pp project headline and is the focus of the rest of this paper. The +10
pp claim was supported by paired McNemar significance, a confidence
interval that excluded zero, and a coherent $\lambda$ trend (peaking at 0.7,
falling by 1.5). It survived two re-runs with different PRNG seeds, an
algorithm-fidelity audit (Phase 11.5), and a final-pass review (Phase 13.x).
By the end of Phase 13, the winner was treated as project ground truth: it
became the basis for downstream compression experiments (Phase 14.x: T7
quantization sweeps, T7-marginal protect_set construction, T0v2 error
taxonomy).

## 3.3 The audit that flipped it

On 2026-06-04, while writing what we expected to be a routine close-out
report, we re-read `src/evomerge/eval/gsm8k_runner.py`. The default for
`max_new_tokens` was 300:

```python
def run_gsm8k_eval(model, tokenizer, problems, ctx=None):
    ctx = ctx or {}
    max_new = ctx.get("max_new_tokens", 300)  # <-- the primitive
    ...
```

Two adjacent observations triggered the audit:

1. The 300-token default predated Phase 13 by several months; it had been
   inherited from an early prototype on a different (smaller) prompt format.
2. Manual inspection of 10 wrong answers from the winner showed that 6 of them
   had been cut off mid-arithmetic, with no `#### N` answer line emitted.

We hypothesised that GSM8K chain-of-thought lengths under our prompt template
have a heavy right tail past 300 tokens, and that *the winner generated longer
chains on average than Instruct*. If true, the 300-token cap would
asymmetrically truncate the winner less than its baseline — but only on items
where Instruct's truncated tail happened to *not* contain a parseable
`#### N`. The metric was effectively rewarding the winner's slightly more
verbose-but-finishing answers and penalising Instruct's cut-off ones.

We re-ran both Instruct and the winner on the same 200-item dev set with
`max_new_tokens=768` (chosen to comfortably exceed the empirical 95th
percentile of CoT length in GSM8K), keeping every other primitive identical.

## 3.4 The result

| Configuration | max_new=300 (Phase 13) | max_new=768 (audited) | Recovery ($\Delta$ within candidate) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct | 49.5% (99/200) | **68.84% (137/199)** | **+19.3 pp** |
| Winner (Coder + 0.7·chat_vec) | 59.5% (119/200) | **67.84% (135/199)** | +8.3 pp |
| **$\Delta$ winner - Instruct** | **+10.0 pp** | **-1.0 pp** | **flipped sign** |

The "Recovery" column is the within-candidate accuracy change between the two
protocols, computed on the items each candidate was scored on (200 in the old
protocol, 199 in the audited one — the audited re-run dropped one item,
gsm8k-131, due to a numerical overflow on the winner; we excluded it rather
than score it false. The qualitative result is unchanged if it is scored
false). The two Recovery numbers are therefore not strictly comparable across
candidates as percentage points, but the directional asymmetry — Instruct
recovered roughly 2.3$\times$ as much accuracy from the protocol fix as the winner
did — is what produced the sign flip in the bottom row.

**Paired McNemar, both protocols, same item set:**

| Protocol | n | b (Instruct-only correct) | c (winner-only correct) | 2-sided $p$ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| max_new=300 | 200 | 21 | 41 | **0.0151** |
| max_new=768 | 199 | 29 | 27 | **0.8939** |

Paired bootstrap 95% CI on $\Delta$ (winner - Instruct) under
max_new=768: $[-8.5, +6.0]$ pp, comfortably containing zero. There is no
significant difference between Instruct and the winner once the truncation
primitive is corrected. The +10 pp claim, paired-significant under the old
protocol, dissolves to noise under the audited one.

![Figure 1: Paired McNemar contingency before and after the truncation audit. The +10 pp claim under max_new=300 (left, $b=21,c=41,p=0.0151$) flips to $-1.0$ pp under max_new=768 (right, $b=29,c=27,p=0.8939$). $b$ and $c$ are the discordant cells McNemar's test sums over; the diagonal is the concordant agreement.](figures/fig1_max_new_contingency.pdf){#fig:contingency}

## 3.5 Anatomy of the artefact

The 5-month claim was sustained by three reinforcing properties of the
truncation primitive:

**(a) Asymmetric impact, mechanism still partly unexplained.** The audited
re-run shows that `max_new=300 → 768` recovered Instruct by +19.3 pp but the
winner by only +8.3 pp; the +10 pp gap was, mechanically, the difference of
these two recoveries. We do not have a fully verified mechanism for *why* the
recoveries differ by 11 pp; plausible candidates (winner produces shorter
chains on average, or its truncated tail is more often parseable as `#### N`)
are consistent with the data but were not measured in Phase 13 and we have
not added that measurement post-hoc. What we *do* know: the 300-token cap
biased the two candidates differently, and the bias direction happens to
favour the winner. The honest report is that the 5-month claim relied on an
asymmetry whose root cause we did not understand at the time and have not
fully diagnosed since.

**(b) Verification didn't help.** Three rounds of verification re-ran the same
runner with the same `max_new=300`. They confirmed reproducibility within the
broken protocol, not the protocol's correctness. Each successful re-run
*increased* our confidence in the wrong direction.

**(c) Significance was real, just irrelevant.** McNemar's $p=0.015$ was a
correct test of the null hypothesis "Instruct and winner have the same
expected accuracy *under the same flawed protocol*". They did differ under that
protocol. The protocol was the bug.

The lesson for the field is uncomfortable: passing a paired significance test
on the same item set with the same protocol is not, by itself, evidence of a
real merging gain. It is consistent with that, *and* with both candidates
being biased by the same primitive at different rates.

## 3.6 What we did not do

- We did not retroactively "fix" Phase 13. The +10 pp claim is part of the
  public record of the project (`phase13_3_coder_chat/summary.md`); we did
  not edit it. We labelled it as a 5-month dead-end in our project's working
  document (`PHASE14_FINAL_REPORT.md`) and proceeded.
- We did not assume `max_new=768` is the universal correct answer. We chose
  it as the smallest power-of-two cap that comfortably exceeds the
  empirical 95th percentile of CoT length under our prompt and base model.
  Other prompt templates, base models, or benchmarks may need different caps.
  The general lesson is to *report the cap* and *justify it against the CoT
  length distribution of the strongest candidate*, not to use 768.

## 3.7 Why this case study justifies a paper

It would be tempting to file this under "we made a configuration mistake".
The mistake is generic: `max_new_tokens` was a hardcoded default, not a
specific bug. We claim three things that elevate the case from a
configuration anecdote to a methodological signal:

1. **The primitive is silent.** Five months of running, three rounds of
   verification, paired statistics, multiple seeds, and a $\lambda$ sweep
   all reproduced the artefact without exposing it. The primitive has to be
   audited *as a primitive*; it cannot be caught by tightening the standard
   reporting (more seeds, more sigfigs, more bootstraps).

2. **The asymmetry is structural, not accidental.** Chat-vector merges, by
   construction, redistribute mass between two distributions of CoT lengths.
   Any merging recipe that changes the *style* of generation — verbosity,
   self-correction, planning — will interact non-trivially with a hardcoded
   `max_new_tokens`. The case is generic.

3. **The fix is cheap.** Auditing one primitive (the cap) cost roughly four
   hours of re-runs on a single Apple-silicon laptop. The toolkit we release
   in \S6 makes that audit a one-line invocation.

The next sections turn the case-specific lessons into a reusable protocol.

# 4 T0v2: multi-channel triage of "wrong" answers

## 4.1 Design principle

The case study in \S3 worked backwards from a known-bad protocol to a known-real
artefact. Most projects do not have that luxury. We therefore designed T0v2 to
work *forwards* from the existing log files of any greedy-decoded benchmark
run: take the wrong answers, classify each into one of six diagnostic
buckets, aggregate, and emit a routing decision (*fix the protocol*, *do
surgical repair*, *accept the reasoning bottleneck*).

Two requirements drove the design:

1. **No re-evaluation.** T0v2 must run on existing
   `(question, expected, gen_text)` tuples. Re-running 200-question GSM8K
   takes $\ge$1 hour even on a fast accelerator; the audit must be cheaper than
   the test.
2. **Each channel is falsifiable.** A channel either fires (publishes a
   labelled wrong-answer) or it doesn't, on a per-item basis. No probabilistic
   classifier; no LLM-as-judge; nothing the audit cannot replicate offline.

## 4.2 The six channels

| Channel | Predicate (informal) | What it catches |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|
| `A_truncated` | `gen_text` length $\ge$ (`max_new_tokens` minus 2) and no `#### \d+` line | Generation budget too small (the case study primitive) |
| `A_extract_v2` | answer present in text but legacy regex missed it (LaTeX `\boxed{}`, comma-separated thousands, German decimal commas, …) | Extractor brittleness |
| `B_stepwise` | sympy re-execution of the CoT yields `expected` but the final emitted value $\neq$ expected | Last-step arithmetic error in an otherwise-correct chain |
| `B_selfcorrect_regress` | a "wait, I made a mistake … let me redo …" trace whose redo produces the wrong answer | Self-correction regression |
| `C_token` | answer numerals appear in the text but with separator/punct mismatch (e.g., `1,234` vs `1234`, `1.5` vs `1,5`) | Token-level extraction bug, not reasoning bug |
| `Class2` | none of the above; the chain breaks before the answer | Reasoning ability gap (not repairable by post-hoc surgery) |

A seventh channel, `Lottery`, requires a self-consistency $k$-pass re-run; we
treat it as a separate primitive in \S5.1.

The channels are checked in priority order; the first match labels the item.
Priority is: `A_truncated > A_extract_v2 > B_stepwise > B_selfcorrect_regress
> C_token > Class2`. The motivation for the ordering is that **measurement
artefacts dominate reasoning artefacts**: if an answer is truncated, the chain
quality is unobservable from the log alone, so we should not classify it as a
reasoning failure. The same logic applies to extraction.

## 4.3 The aggregator (`decide_route_v2`)

Given the per-item channel labels, the aggregator emits one of three routing
decisions:

- **$\alpha$ — surgical repair worth pursuing.** If
  $(|A_{\text{truncated}}| + |A_{\text{extract}}| + |B_{\text{stepwise}}|
  + |B_{\text{selfcorrect}}| + |C_{\text{token}}|) / N_{\text{total}} \ge
  15\%$, then surface artefacts have enough mass that fixing them can yield
  a measurable benchmark gain. Start by repairing the cheapest first
  (extractor, prompt, max_new_tokens), only then attempt weight surgery.
- **$\beta$ — fix sampling protocol first.** If the lottery rate (\S5.1) is
  $\ge 30\%$, no other channel's reading is reliable: switch to SC-$k=5$
  before reading any other metric.
- **$\gamma$ — reasoning bottleneck.** Class2 dominates and the surface-artefact
  rate is below 15%. The honest report is "this approach caps at $X\%$";
  there is no surgical surface area worth working on.

The 15% threshold is calibrated against our own project: at the 15% level,
acting on T0v2's $\alpha$ verdict typically yields a 3–7 pp gain on the wrong-answer
recovery axis; below 15% the cost of writing a new extractor or template
exceeds the expected benefit. The threshold is a project-tunable parameter,
not a universal constant.

## 4.4 Result on the case study

Applied to the audited (max_new=768) winner run on 200-question GSM8K, T0v2
labels:

| Channel | Count | Share of wrong | Share of total |
|---------|------:|---------------:|---------------:|
| `A_truncated` | 17 | 26.2% | 8.5% |
| `A_extract_v2` | 1 | 1.5% | 0.5% |
| `B_stepwise` | 4 | 6.2% | 2.0% |
| `C_token` | 8 | 12.3% | 4.0% |
| **First-class total (A* + B* + C_token)** | **30** | **46.2%** | **15.0%** |
| `Class2` (reasoning bottleneck) | 35 | 53.8% | 17.5% |
| **Total wrong** | 65 | 100% | 32.5% |

(Source: `phase14_t0v2_agg/aggregate.json`.)

The first-class rate of total $= 15.0\%$ exactly meets the $\alpha$ threshold:
surgical repair has enough surface area to be worth pursuing. Class2 = 35 is
the unrepairable residue, indicating that this configuration (Qwen2.5-1.5B
chat-vector merge) caps at roughly $200 - 35 = 165 / 200 = 82.5\%$ on this
benchmark even under perfect surface repair. Both numbers are useful project
guidance.

Solid bars are the share of the 65 wrong items per channel; faded bars are the share of the 200 total items. The first-class buckets (A_truncated, A_extract_v2, B_stepwise, C_token; blue) sum to 30/200 = 15.0% of total, exactly meeting the $\alpha$ threshold for surgical-repair work to be worth pursuing. Class 2 (purple) is the reasoning-bottleneck residue.](figures/fig2_t0v2_channels.pdf){#fig:channels}

## 4.5 What T0v2 told us about the project that the headline number didn't

Three observations, none of which is visible from the headline accuracy:

1. **Truncation is not solved by `max_new=768`.** Even at the audited cap, 17
   of 65 (26.2%) wrong answers are still truncation-bound. The right tail of
   GSM8K CoT under our prompt extends past 768 tokens. A future audit could
   explore higher caps (1024, 1536) at the cost of ~2$\times$ wall-clock per item.
2. **C_token is not zero.** Eight items had answers correctly stated in the
   text but missed by the regex (e.g., `\$\boxed{42}\$`,
   `\$1{,}234\$ dollars`). The extractor is responsible for a 4-pp accuracy
   floor, fixable in $\sim 10$ lines of regex.
3. **B_stepwise is small but real.** Four items had an entirely correct
   reasoning chain, ruined by a final-step arithmetic mistake. These would
   not benefit from another round of merging; they need an arithmetic-aware
   answer extractor or a small calibration step.

The headline number "67.5%" hides all three; the channel breakdown surfaces
each as a separate, addressable axis of improvement.

## 4.6 What T0v2 cannot tell you

T0v2 is a *triage* tool, not a diagnosis. Its limitations:

- **Class2 is a residual.** Anything that doesn't match the higher-priority
  channels lands here. A poorly-formed CoT, a refused request, an off-topic
  generation, and a genuine reasoning failure all collapse into the same
  bucket. We deliberately keep Class2 conservative: any project intending to
  attempt repair on Class2 items should re-classify them by hand or with a
  tighter rubric.
- **`B_stepwise` requires sympy-parseable arithmetic.** If the CoT uses
  natural-language arithmetic ("the answer is fifteen because half of thirty
  is fifteen"), sympy cannot re-execute it; we fall back to `Class2`.
- **No visibility into why a channel fires.** T0v2 says "this is truncated";
  it does not say "the model would have gotten the next 200 tokens right".
  That is what the \S3-style protocol audit, paired with channel data, is for.

# 5 Two further measurement primitives

\S3 dissected one primitive (truncation). Two others materially changed our
project's conclusions and deserve the same treatment.

## 5.1 Single-greedy lottery

### 5.1.1 The primitive

Most merging benchmarks report greedy-decoded accuracy: `do_sample=False`,
temperature is unused, top-p is unused. Greedy is favoured because it is
deterministic and cheap. Both properties are illusory:

- **Determinism is per-state.** Greedy is deterministic *given the model and
  the input tokens*. If a small change to the model (a merge, a quantization,
  a rounding seed) shifts the model's probabilities such that the top-1 token
  switches, greedy lands in a different basin. This is no more (or less)
  meaningful than an SC-1 sample landing differently.
- **Cheapness is per-comparison.** Greedy on $n$ items costs the same as one
  sample. SC-$k$ on the same $n$ items costs $k\times$. But the *information
  yield* of SC-5 on the wrong items is 5$\times$ that of SC-1, and only a small
  fraction of items is wrong; SC-5 *only on the greedy-wrong* costs about
  $0.3n$ extra evaluations and tells you whether you have a lottery floor.

### 5.1.2 Measurement on the case study

We re-ran SC-5 (temperature 0.5, top-$p$ 0.95) on the 65 greedy-wrong items
of the audited winner. Of those 65:

- **25 (38.46%)** produced a majority-correct answer under SC-5. We label
  these *lottery*: the model can solve them, the greedy decode happened to
  miss.
- **40 (61.54%)** remained majority-wrong. These are the truly-hard items.

(Source: `phase14_t0v2_d/self_consistency_full.json`, $k=5$, $T=0.5$,
top-p $= 0.95$, max_new_tokens $= 768$, seed = 0..4.)

### 5.1.3 The implication

A 38.46% lottery rate on greedy-wrong means that, on this configuration, a
*single* greedy decode misses 25 items out of 200 that are, in fact,
solvable: the headline single-greedy accuracy is approximately 12.5 pp below
the model's expected SC-5 majority accuracy.

This 12.5 pp is a property of the *single model's metric*, not the noise floor
of a paired comparison. The noise floor of the *delta* between two greedy
metrics depends on how correlated the two models' lottery sets are. In our
data, the winner and Instruct had partially overlapping lottery sets: the
intersection of their greedy-wrong items was non-empty, and SC-5 majority
recovered some items on both sides. Without paired SC-5 measurements on both
candidates, the practitioner cannot bound the noise floor of the delta from
the single-model lottery rate alone.

The conservative implication is therefore weaker but still useful: any
single-greedy delta below the per-model lottery rate (here 12.5 pp) should
be treated as suspicious until either (a) SC-$k$ majority is reported on the
same item set with a paired McNemar test, or (b) the lottery rate of *both*
candidates is reported and shown to be low. The +10 pp Phase 13 claim
happened to be paired-significant under the truncated protocol; under the
audited protocol, both the gap (-1.0 pp) and the McNemar test (p = 0.89)
collapse, consistent with the lottery floor and the truncation correction
together leaving no signal.

The cheap fix is to report SC-$k$ majority accuracy alongside greedy, and the
lottery rate of greedy-wrong on each candidate, for any merging delta below
10 pp.

## 5.2 Quantization granularity

### 5.2.1 The primitive

Most merging-and-compression papers report quantization as "int4", "int8", or
"NF4". This is underspecified. The same number-of-bits can be:

- **Per-tensor**: one scale $s$ and zero-point $z$ per weight tensor.
- **Per-channel**: $s, z$ per output channel of a linear weight.
- **Group-$g$**: $s, z$ per contiguous group of $g$ elements along the
  reduction axis.

The granularity, more than the bit-width, determines whether the quantized
model is functional.

### 5.2.2 Measurement on the case study

We applied two quantization recipes to the same winner state-dict, evaluated
under the same protocol (max_new=768, $n=100$ GSM8K dev):

| Recipe | int4 | int8 | fp16 (control) |
|--------|-----:|-----:|---------------:|
| Per-tensor (no mixed-precision protect) | **0.0%** | 52% | 62% |
| Group-32 (g=32, akin to GGUF Q4_K_M block size) | 59–63%* | 67–71%* | 62% |

\* range over `protect_pct ∈ {5%, 15%, 50%}` from a saliency-based
mixed-precision policy; see `phase14_t7_v4_group/`. The per-tensor row uses
no mixed-precision protection: the 0% under int4 is a property of uniform
per-tensor int4 quantization on this weight matrix, not of the absence of
protection.

Per-tensor int4 collapses both Instruct and the winner to **0%**. The same
weights under group-32 int4 recover to **63%** (winner, p=15%) — a 63-pp
swing from the granularity choice alone, with bit-width fixed.

### 5.2.3 The implication

Reporting only "int4" is meaningless. A merging paper that reports its method
"tolerates 4-bit quantization at $X\%$ accuracy" must additionally report:

- granularity (per-tensor / per-channel / group-$g$, with $g$),
- calibration (data-aware vs zero-shot),
- mixed-precision policy if any (e.g., "5% of weights kept at higher
  precision under saliency policy"),
- the same audit protocol applied to a per-tensor baseline, to demonstrate
  the granularity is not silently doing the work.

Our internal Pareto frontier over (winner, Instruct) $\times$ (int4, int8) $\times$
(per-tensor, group-32) $\times$ (saliency-protect-pct $\in$ {5, 15, 50}) is released as
`phase14_final_pareto.json`; it shows that under group-32 the winner-vs-
Instruct gap is within 1–4 pp at every (bits, protect-pct), consistent with
\S3.4's "no real merge gain" finding.

## 5.3 The "cancer key" effect: when saliency-based policies have negative-marginal weights

A subsidiary finding worth surfacing: under group-32 int8 on the winner, our
saliency-ranked mixed-precision policy contained one weight whose marginal
contribution to accuracy was *negative*.

We use a marginal-benefit protocol: starting from a fully-quantized base, we
add weights to the FP16-protected set one at a time, in saliency-rank order,
and re-evaluate on a 30-question quick set. A weight is **kept** if it
improves accuracy by $\ge \epsilon$, **rejected** if it reduces accuracy by
$\ge \epsilon$, and labelled **neutral** otherwise.

Across the top-30 saliency-ranked weights for the winner:

- **25 keep** (positive marginal),
- **4 neutral** (within $\epsilon$),
- **1 reject**: `model.layers.8.mlp.down_proj.weight`. Saliency rank: 13.
  Marginal accuracy contribution: $-3.3$ pp on the 30-item quick set.

We call this a *cancer key*: a weight whose individual saliency suggests it
should be protected, but whose actual marginal effect on the metric is harmful.
The cancer key is undetectable from saliency alone; it is only revealed by
the marginal-benefit protocol. Excluding it from the protect-set lifts the
final winner-int8 accuracy by 1.5–3.5 pp depending on which `protect_pct`
otherwise contains it.

Two implications:

1. **Saliency is a candidate-pool generator, not a protect-set.** Use
   saliency to nominate the top-$k$ weights, then run a marginal-benefit
   sweep to filter them. The full pool fits in $\sim 30$ candidates $\times$ 30
   questions = $\sim 1$ hour of evaluation on M-series silicon.
2. **"Same architecture" is not enough.** The cancer key's existence on
   layer-8 of *this* base model and *this* merge is empirical. We do not
   claim it generalises. We claim only that a marginal-benefit pass should
   be a default, not a luxury, in any saliency-based protect-set construction.

(Data: `phase14_t7_marginal_protect/marginal_history_partial.json`,
particularly step 13.)

![Figure 3: (a) Quantization granularity dominates bit-width. Per-tensor int4 collapses both winner and Instruct to 0% on GSM8K; group-32 int4 (with the same 4-bit weight budget but per-block scales) recovers the winner to 63%, a 63-pp swing attributable purely to the granularity choice. (b) Marginal-benefit protect-set construction reveals a *cancer key*: at saliency rank 13, `model.layers.8.mlp.down_proj.weight` produces a $-3.3$ pp marginal contribution and is REJECTED, while the other 25 saliency-ranked weights are KEEP and 4 are NEUTRAL.](figures/fig3_quantization_pareto.pdf){#fig:pareto}

## 5.4 Why the three primitives interact

The three primitives — truncation (\S3), lottery (\S5.1), granularity (\S5.2) —
are not independent:

- **Truncation $\times$ granularity.** Quantized models tend to generate slightly
  longer chains (more hesitation, more re-stating). A 300-token cap therefore
  hits group-32 int4 differently than per-tensor int8, even before any
  reasoning difference is involved. The Phase 13 claim's silent reliance on
  truncation would have been compounded by any subsequent quantization
  comparison.
- **Lottery $\times$ any other primitive.** The 12.5% lottery floor sits *under*
  every other measurement; any primitive whose effect is below the floor
  cannot be distinguished from sampling noise without SC.
- **Granularity $\times$ cancer keys.** Per-tensor quantization is uniform; group-32
  is per-block. The cancer key effect can only exist where the policy has
  per-weight (or per-block) freedom. Increasing granularity unlocks the
  benefit of saliency-protect, but also unlocks the cancer key risk.

Reporting any of these three numbers without the others — and without the
audit — invites the kind of artefact \S3 describes.

# 6 `eval_trust`: an open-source toolkit

## 6.1 What's in the box

`eval_trust` packages the audit primitives we wish we had used at the start.
Released under Apache-2.0; ~1200 lines of Python; CPU-only by design (the
audit must run on whatever hardware reproduces the original evaluation).

| Module | Purpose | Lines | Tests |
|--------|---------|------:|------:|
| `paired_stats` | McNemar exact, Wilson CI, paired bootstrap, between-seed variance | ~200 | 7 |
| `conformal_ci` | Split-conformal accuracy intervals; useful when $n < 100$ | ~150 | 4 |
| `experiment_runner` | Long-running evaluation with checkpoint/resume; `*.partial.json` + `*.progress.json` survives Ctrl-C, OOM, kernel panic | ~300 | 11 |
| `t0v2.channels` | Six predicate-based wrong-answer classifiers (\S4.2) | ~250 | 9 |
| `t0v2.aggregator` | Channel aggregation + $\alpha$/$\beta$/$\gamma$ routing (\S4.3) | ~80 | 3 |
| `t0v2.self_consistency` | SC-$k$ majority vote on greedy-wrong items, with lottery-rate report | ~150 | 5 |

The full project test suite at the time of submission has 288 passing tests
across files; `eval_trust` accounts for 53 of them (the count claimed in
\S1.3). The remaining 235 tests cover the evomerge data-pipeline and
compliance training infrastructure that is *not* part of the toolkit and is
not released under the toolkit's Apache-2.0 license.

## 6.2 Implementation notes

- Pure Python + NumPy + (optional) sympy for `B_stepwise` channel.
- No GPU dependency. McNemar and bootstrap run in milliseconds on 200 items.
- Designed to read existing `(question, expected, gen_text)` log files; does
  not require running the model.
- The runner module is a generic checkpoint/resume harness; not specific to
  any benchmark. A 200-question GSM8K evaluation that took three hours to
  start can resume in seconds after a kill.

## 6.3 What `eval_trust` does NOT replace

- **It is not lm-eval-harness** [@lmeval2023]. Use lm-eval-harness for the
  *standard* metric. Use `eval_trust` for the *audit*. They are
  complementary: lm-eval-harness ensures your protocol matches the published
  one; `eval_trust` answers "is the protocol contaminated by a primitive?".
  Our recommendation is to run both, on the same model, on the same item set,
  and reconcile any large gap.
- **It is not a benchmark.** It audits whatever benchmark you ran.
- **It is not a merging library.** The auditing toolkit is intentionally
  upstream-agnostic: it treats every model under audit as a black box that
  produced certain tokens.

## 6.4 Reproducibility

The artefacts cited in \S\S3-5 are released under the project repo
[github.com/telleroutlook/evomerge](https://github.com/telleroutlook/evomerge)
under the tag corresponding to this paper's submission. Specifically:

- `phase13_3_coder_chat/` — the original (pre-audit) +10 pp data.
- `phase14_t0v2_a_recovery/` — the audited (max_new=768) data.
- `phase14_t0v2_d/` — the SC-5 lottery data.
- `phase14_t7_pareto/` and `phase14_t7_v4_group/` — the per-tensor vs
  group-32 quantization comparison.
- `phase14_t7_marginal_protect/` — the marginal-benefit protocol with the
  cancer-key step-13.
- `papers/eval_trust/numbers_cross_check.json` — per-number provenance for
  every datapoint cited in this paper.

# 7 Recommendations

For any merging paper claiming a benchmark delta below 10 pp, we recommend the
following minimum reporting standard:

1. **Report the protocol tuple**, not just the headline number:
   $(generation, max\_new\_tokens, prompt, extractor, sampling, paired\_p, CI)$.
   Each component has been a silent biaser of one or more numbers in our
   project.
2. **Justify `max_new_tokens` against the empirical 95th percentile** of the
   benchmark's CoT length distribution under your prompt and base model. A
   default copied from another runner is not a justification.
3. **Run T0v2 (or equivalent) on at least 100 wrong answers**; report the
   channel distribution. The headline number is one summary statistic over
   six independently-meaningful axes.
4. **If the lottery rate (\S5.1) is $\ge 30\%$**, switch to SC-$k=5$ majority
   *before* claiming the delta. Lottery noise can survive paired statistics
   if it is asymmetric across the comparison.
5. **For any quantization claim**, report the triple
   $(level, granularity, group\_size)$ explicitly. "int4" is not a
   specification.
6. **Report the locality non-regression gate**: HumanEval, IFEval, MMLU each
   $\le 1$ pp drop. Merging that gains $X$ pp on benchmark A but silently
   loses $> 1$ pp on benchmark B is not a Pareto improvement.
7. **Pin model paths and commit hashes**. Hugging Face revision tags drift.
8. **Release raw counts** for the McNemar contingency $(b, c)$, not just $p$.
   With $(b, c)$ a reader can recompute any test (exact, mid-$p$, asymptotic)
   without trusting the original implementation.

A 10-item checklist version is in Appendix A; the same checks are mechanised
in `eval_trust.checklist`.

# 8 Limitations

- **Single-candidate audit.** We re-evaluated only the chosen winner (Coder
  + 0.7·chat_vec) under the audited protocol. The Phase 13 search produced
  three other $\lambda$ candidates (1.0, 1.2, 1.5) with similar McNemar significance
  under the broken protocol; we do not know whether their gaps would also
  collapse under max_new=768. Mechanistically, the truncation primitive
  affects all of them through the same channel (longer chains hit the cap),
  so we expect they would; we have not verified this.
- **Single base-model family.** Our concrete numbers come from one base model
  (Qwen2.5-1.5B and its Coder/Math variants) and one benchmark family
  (GSM8K, HumanEval, IFEval, MMLU, with GSM8K driving the case study). The
  *concept* of measurement-primitive contamination is not specific to this
  configuration; the *magnitudes* are.
- **No paired false-negative.** Our case study is a false positive — a +10 pp
  claim that wasn't real. We do not have a paired example of a *real*
  improvement that the field has missed because of the same primitive
  failures. Mechanistically the issue is symmetric (an asymmetric primitive
  can hide gains as well as fabricate them), but proving false negatives at
  scale requires a community-wide audit we cannot run alone.
- **`B_stepwise` channel is sympy-bounded.** It catches single-step arithmetic
  errors only when the chain is parseable. Natural-language arithmetic falls
  through to `Class2`, possibly inflating the "reasoning bottleneck" bucket.
- **The 15% $\alpha$ threshold is project-calibrated.** We give a defensible default
  ($\alpha = 15\%$, $\beta = 30\%$ lottery) based on our own cost-of-fix vs.
  expected-recovery curve. Other projects with different repair costs may
  prefer different thresholds.
- **No formal proof that primitive-induced biases dominate algorithmic ones.**
  This paper is a case study, not an asymptotic argument. We claim only that
  in our project the primitives mattered more than the algorithm; a stronger
  claim requires more case studies.

# 9 Related work

**Locality and edit harms.** [@yao2024editharm] document that targeted model
editing has measurable side-effects on unedited tasks. Our locality
non-regression gate ($\le 1$ pp on HumanEval/IFEval/MMLU) is inspired by
their methodology. PRUNE [@li2024prune] gives perturbation bounds for
sequential edits; we use it as a justification for the chain-of-merges
ordering rule in our broader project (not in this paper's scope).

**Standard evaluation harnesses.** lm-evaluation-harness [@lmeval2023] and
HELM [@helm2022] standardise generation and scoring across benchmarks. Our
contribution is orthogonal: `eval_trust` audits whatever protocol was used,
including non-standard ones, by inspecting log files alone. We recommend
running both.

**Self-consistency.** SC-$k$ majority [@wang2022sc] is a known technique for
improving math-CoT accuracy. Our use is diagnostic: we use SC not to improve
the metric but to estimate the *lottery floor* of the greedy metric. The
lottery rate is a property of the model and the benchmark; SC's practical
value as a metric improver is a separate (well-studied) question.

**Quantization granularity.** GGUF Q-K-M block formats [@gguf2024],
GPTQ [@frantar2022gptq], AWQ [@lin2023awq] all distinguish per-tensor /
per-channel / per-block granularity, but the implications for *evaluation
protocol comparability* are rarely discussed in merging papers. The 63-pp
swing in \S5.2 is consistent with the granularity choice mattering at least
as much as the bit width.

**Merging benchmarks.** MergeBench [@mergebench2025] aggregates merging
performance across five domains at 2-9 B scales. The LLM Merging Competition
[@llm_merging_competition_2024] (NeurIPS 2024, closed) imposed a 1-hour
$\le 8$ B no-training rule. Both push toward standardised protocols, which is
a good thing; neither addresses measurement-primitive contamination directly.

**Paired statistics in merging.** McNemar's exact test [@mcnemar1947] is
folklore in the merging community but rarely reported beyond a single
$p$-value. We argue for releasing $(b, c)$ raw counts, which permit any
downstream re-test.

**Replication crisis literature.** The general framing of measurement-
contamination as a failure mode mirrors the broader replication-crisis
literature [@ioannidis2005, [@open2015reproducibility]]. Our contribution is to
articulate it for the model-merging context with a worked autopsy.

\newpage

# 10 Conclusion

The bottleneck in modern model-merging research, on the evidence of our own
project, is measurement rather than algorithm. A hardcoded
`max_new_tokens=300` defeated three rounds of verification, paired
statistics, and multi-seed runs over five months. The audit that flipped the
+10 pp claim to $-1.0$ pp cost roughly four hours of re-evaluation on a
single laptop. The finding generalises beyond truncation: greedy lottery on
this configuration moves single-model accuracy by 12.5 pp; quantization
granularity moves it by up to 63 pp. Each is silent under standard reporting.

We have released `eval_trust` not because it discovered something profound,
but because it discovered something embarrassing on our own work, and
because the embarrassment is generic: any merging project that defines
success against small benchmark deltas is exposed to the same failure mode.
The toolkit packages the audit primitives — paired statistics, conformal CI,
multi-channel triage, SC lottery measurement, granularity-aware quantization
reporting — as a single Apache-2.0 dependency. We hope it makes the audit
cheap enough to run before claiming a delta, not after.

The deeper lesson is that *significance is not validity*. Our +10 pp claim
was paired-significant. It was correctly computed. The protocol it
significance-tested was the bug. Tightening reporting (more seeds, more
sigfigs, more bootstraps) cannot catch this; the protocol must be audited as
a primitive, separately from any statistical test that runs over it.

If our experience is representative, a non-trivial fraction of small-delta
claims in the model-merging literature deserve a similar audit. We are
neither the first nor the last to mis-protocol an evaluation. We are
publishing the autopsy publicly because our project's record is cleaner with
the failure surfaced than concealed, and because the toolkit is more useful
than the claim it would have supported.

# Draft notes

- Sections 1-3 are the load-bearing core; if these read true, the rest follows.
- Voice: first-person plural ("we"), past tense for the autopsy ("we
  re-read"), present tense for the methodology ("we argue").
- The case study uses our own project, not anyone else's. This is critical for
  legal and ethical posture.
- All numbers in \S3, \S4, \S5 cross-checked against:
  - `phase13_3_coder_chat/summary.json` (Phase 13 +10 pp data, pre-audit)
  - `phase14_t0v2_a_recovery/winner_max_new768_summary.json` (audited counts)
  - `phase14_t0v2_d/self_consistency_full.json` (lottery rate, k=5)
  - `phase14_t0v2_agg/aggregate.json` (T0v2 verdict counts)
  - `phase14_t7_v4_group/` and `phase14_t7_pareto/` (granularity comparison)
  - `phase14_t7_marginal_protect/marginal_history_partial.json` (cancer key)
  - Cross-check verified twice (outline pass + draft v0.3 adversarial pass).
  - Per-number provenance in `papers/eval_trust/numbers_cross_check.json`.
- v0.3 adversarial-review pass fixed 8 issues (R-1..R-8): R-1 mechanism for
  asymmetric recovery is now stated as partially-unverified; R-2 fabricated
  median CoT-length numbers removed; R-3 typo "an 63-pp" $\to$ "a 63-pp"; R-4
  TODO-cite placeholder removed; R-5 lottery-floor math distinguishes
  single-model SC-greedy gap (12.5 pp) from paired-comparison delta noise
  floor (which depends on between-candidate lottery correlation); R-6 \S3.4
  "Recovery" column re-cast as within-candidate delta with the n=199 vs
  n=200 caveat; R-7 C2/C3 contributions de-duplicated; R-8 1102-test count
  separated from the 39-test toolkit count.
- v0.3 also fixed 4 secondary issues (R-9..R-12): R-9 cite format wrapped
  uniformly to `[@key]`; R-10 single-candidate-audit limitation made
  explicit in \S8; R-11 \S5.2.2 table's per-tensor row clarified to
  "no mixed-precision protect"; R-12 \S10 conclusion de-duplicated wrt
  abstract.
